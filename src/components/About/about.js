          <p>
            I am a graduate student of the University of Utah's Full Stack Web Development bootcamp. Currently I am a General Manager in the quick service restaurant industy for the last 14 years at the same company. I started as a regular daytime lunch worker and with ambition I moved up the chain quickly and was a GM in the first 4 years of working there. I am now looking to change careers to continue to grow and be able to provide for my family. Givin the opportunity I believe I have what it takes to make those same jumps in a new career.
